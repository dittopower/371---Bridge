# 371---Bridge
A basic project based on the card game bridge.

Very Brief:
Contract Bridge is one of the world’s most popular card games and is played world-wide in clubs, in tournaments, online and socially.
It is a trick-taking game using a standard 52 card deck.  The cards are in four suits – Spades, Hearts, Diamond and Clubs – and each 
card has a rank.  The ranks from lowest to highest in each suit are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and finally Ace.

The decision about which suit will be the trump suit is part of each hand and is known as the auction.  On each trick, where each player
plays one card from their hand, the players must play a card of the same suit as the card that was lead if they have one in their hand.
If they do not have a card in the suit which was lead they may play a card from any other suit.  If they play a card from the trump suit,
that card beats the cards from the original suit that was played. 

 This project only involves setting up the deck of cards, shuffling and dealing the cards to the players and deciding on who will make the opening bid for each hand.
